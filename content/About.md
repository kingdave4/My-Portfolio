## 🚀 My Journey: From IT Support to Cloud Engineering

I have always been deeply passionate about technology, and over time, I realized that my true calling lies in **DevOps and Cloud Engineering**. My journey began in **IT support**, where I gained hands-on experience troubleshooting systems, managing infrastructure, and ensuring seamless IT operations. While I valued this experience, I knew I wanted to **build and automate** rather than just maintain systems.

## 🌟 Why Cloud & DevOps?

The more I learned about **cloud computing and automation**, the more fascinated I became. The idea of managing infrastructure as code (IaC), deploying applications seamlessly, and automating workflows resonated with me. Tools like **Terraform, Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions** showed me how infrastructure can be built, deployed, and scaled efficiently.

## 🔧 Skills I’ve Gained

Throughout my transition, I have built a strong foundation in:

✅ **Cloud Technologies** – Working with AWS services like **S3, Glue, Athena, and CloudWatch** to automate and manage infrastructure.

✅ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Using **Terraform** to define and deploy cloud resources efficiently.

✅ **CI/CD Pipelines** – Implementing **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and other CI/CD tools** to automate deployments.

✅ **Containerization & Orchestration** – Leveraging **Docker and Kubernetes** to package and manage applications.

✅ **Scripting & Automation** – Writing scripts in **Python, JSON, and YAML** to automate cloud operations.

✅ **Linux Administration** – Enhancing my ability to manage and optimize cloud-based Linux environments.
